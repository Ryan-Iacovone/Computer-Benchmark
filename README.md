# Computer-Benchmark
 Analyzing the performance of my custom built PC using a variety of gaming and synthetic benchmarks. 

 I measured several varaibles as I tested my computer (such as GPU/CPU temperature, power draw, utilization, and clock speed) to see if my PC was performaing as I'd expect for the componenets in there.
